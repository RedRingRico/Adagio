Preamble
--------
This document conveys the main gameplay elements present in Adagio.


Overview
--------
Primarily, Adagio is a game about killing other people with a lot of different
weapons.  In addition to the straight-forward blowing-up of foes, the game can
be augmented with different objectives, such as playing in a team to accrue as
many points as possible by killing non-friendly players, using an explosive
device to blow up another base (the defending team has a chance to disarm the
device), capture an artefact from a team and return it to your base.  This
document will not discuss game modes, but will concentrate on common core
gameplay mechanics.


Player Characters
-----------------
All players share the same base attributes and play the same.  Other than an
alternate player model, base colour scheme, and handle, there is not much to
distinguish one player from the next.  Each player has the following
attributes:

Health - Measured in units ranging from 0 (dead) to 200, health is the
         determining factor in a player remaining in the arena.  Any units over
		 100 will eventually decrease until the health is at 100.  Players
		 begin with 110 units when they enter an arena or respawn.
Armour - Measured in units rangning from 0 (no armour) to 200, armour augments
         a player's health by applying a dampening effect for each ordinary
		 unit of health that would normally be lost until the armour depletes.
		 Players begin with 0 armour units when they enter and arena or
		 respawn.
Weapon - The default weapons for all players are the chain gun (CHAIN) and the
         short-range, last-hope, knife.  The CHAIN is loaded with 100 rounds of
		 ammunition.
